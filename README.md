# 🩺 KNN Diabetes Prediction Model

This project uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to predict whether a person is diabetic based on health measurements like glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, insulin level, and more.

## 📖 About the Project

The goal of this project is to apply **Machine Learning classification** using the KNN algorithm on the famous **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**.  
It was done as part of my Machine Learning assignment, but I have presented it here like a mini-project.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

1. **Loaded the dataset** from an online source.  
2. **Handled missing or invalid data** by replacing zeros with median values.  
3. **Split the data** into training and testing sets (70 % – 30 %).  
4. **Standardized the features** for better KNN performance.  
5. **Trained and compared KNN models** using different algorithms (`brute`, `kd_tree`, `ball_tree`).  
6. **Evaluated model accuracy**, printed reports, and plotted confusion matrices.

## 📊 Results

- The accuracy was compared across multiple KNN algorithm types.  
- The model achieved **around 75 – 80 % accuracy** (this may vary slightly when you run it).  
- Confusion matrices were used to visualize correct vs. wrong predictions.
